      <summary >History</summary>
      Python was conceived in the late 1980s[35] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL),[36] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the
      Amoeba operating system.[8] Its implementation began in December 1989.[37] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his
      responsibilities as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.[38] He now shares his leadership as a member of a five-person
      steering council.[39][40][41] In January 2019, active Python core developers elected Brett Cannon, Nick Coghlan, Barry Warsaw, Carol Willing and Van Rossum to a five-member "Steering Council" to lead the project.[42]

      Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode.[43]

      Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible.[44] Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6.x[45] and 2.7.x version series. Releases of Python 3
      include the 2to3 utility, which automates (at least partially) the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[46]

      Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[47][48]

      <summary> Features and philosophy</summary>

      Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by
      metaprogramming[49] and metaobjects (magic methods)).[50] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[51][52] and logic programming.[53]

      Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.[54] It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program
      execution.

      Python's design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter, map, and reduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.[55] The standard library has two modules
      (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.[56]

      The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:[57]

      Beautiful is better than ugly.
      Explicit is better than implicit.
      Simple is better than complex.
      Complex is better than complicated.
      Readability counts.
      Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van
      Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.[35]

      Python strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl's "there is more than one way to do it" motto, Python embraces a "there should be one—and
      preferably only one—obvious way to do it" design philosophy.[57] Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, writes that "To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the Python
      culture."[58]

      Python's developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.[59] When speed is important, a
      Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or use PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls
      into the Python interpreter.

      An important goal of Python's developers is keeping it fun to use. This is reflected in the language's name—a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python[60]—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such
      as examples that refer to spam and eggs (from a famous Monty Python sketch) instead of the standard foo and bar.[61][62]

      A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the
      language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.

      Users and admirers of Python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as Pythonistas.[63][64]

      <summary> Statements and control flow</summary>

      The assignment statement (token '=', the equals sign). This operates differently than in traditional imperative programming languages, and this fundamental mechanism (including the nature of Python's version of variables) illuminates many other
      features of the language. Assignment in C, e.g., x = 2, translates to "typed variable name x receives a copy of numeric value 2". The (right-hand) value is copied into an allocated storage location for which the (left-hand) variable name is the
      symbolic address. The memory allocated to the variable is large enough (potentially quite large) for the declared type. In the simplest case of Python assignment, using the same example, x = 2, translates to "(generic) name x receives a
      reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object of numeric (int) type of value 2." This is termed binding the name to the object. Since the name's storage location doesn't contain the indicated value, it is improper to call it a variable.
      Names may be subsequently rebound at any time to objects of greatly varying types, including strings, procedures, complex objects with data and methods, etc. Successive assignments of a common value to multiple names, e.g., x = 2; y = 2; z = 2
      result in allocating storage to (at most) three names and one numeric object, to which all three names are bound. Since a name is a generic reference holder it is unreasonable to associate a fixed data type with it. However at a given time a
      name will be bound to some object, which will have a type; thus there is dynamic typing.
      The if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else-if).
      The for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.
      The while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.
      The try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits.
      The raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception.
      The class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming.
      The def statement, which defines a function or method.
      The with statement, from Python 2.5 released in September 2006,[67] which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file and
      then closing it), allowing Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replaces a common try/finally idiom.[68]
      The break statement, exits from the loop.
      The continue statement, skips this iteration and continues with the next item.
      The pass statement, which serves as a NOP. It is syntactically needed to create an empty code block.
      The assert statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that ought to apply.
      The yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function. From Python 2.5, yield is also an operator. This form is used to implement coroutines.
      The import statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program. There are three ways of using import: import <module name> [as <alias>] or from <module name> import * or from <module name>
              import <definition 1> [as <alias 1>], <definition 2> [as <alias 2>], ....
                      The print statement was changed to the print() function in Python 3.
                      Python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to Guido van Rossum, it never will.[69][70] However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided in 2.5, by extending
                      Python's generators.[71] Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5, it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from
                      Python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.[72]
